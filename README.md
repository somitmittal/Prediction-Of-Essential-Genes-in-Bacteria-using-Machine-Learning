# Prediction-Of-Essential-Genes-in-Bacteria-using-Machine-Learning

This was my first Project on Computational Biology. In this project a Machine Learning Approach was used to predict the Essential Genes in Bacteria which can be used in efficient Drug Designing Process. Earlier known methods for gene essentiality prediction were mostly experimental and hence were time consuming, laborious and expensive. Machine Learning techniques can be used as an alternative to predict gene essentiality and are efficient and produce good results.

The project has also been selected for Publication at Springer at ICCI (IIT Kanpur).
